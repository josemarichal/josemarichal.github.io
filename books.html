                                to retain autonomy and human dignity in the coming age.

                                In the age of AI, where personal data fuels corporate profits and state surveillance,
                                what are the implications for democracy?

                                This incisive book explores the unspoken agreement we have with tech companies. In
                                exchange for reducing the anxiety of an increasingly complex online world, we submit to
                                algorithmic classification and predictability. This reduces incentives for us to become
                                “algorithmic problems” with dire consequences for liberal democracy. He calls for a
                                movement to demand that algorithms promote play, creativity and potentiality rather than
                                conformity.

                                This is a must-read for anyone navigating the intersection of technology, politics and
                                identity in an increasingly data-driven world.

                            <p class="book-meta">Routledge (2012)</p>
                            <p> <!-- Optional: Add a short description here if you like -->
                                In July 2010, Facebook had over 500 million subscribers worldwide and the rapid rise of
                                the site prompted Time magazine to name Facebook's founder Mark Zuckerberg its person of
                                the year for 2010. This novel book advances our understanding of how democratic citizens
                                are transformed by the "Facebook revolution". Despite increasing interest in politics
                                and popular media, there has been little academic work on the impact of Facebook on
                                politics in general, and on democratic processes in particular. The work that does exist
                                has been limited to Facebook's impact on politics as a mobilization tool used by social
                                movement activists. In this book, José Marichal argues that understanding Facebook's
                                impact on political processes requires an understanding of how Facebook's architecture
                                of disclosure shapes the construction of individuals' political identities by drawing
                                users further into their pre-selected social networks. Drawing on a number of
                                disciplines and an ethnographic analysis of 250 Facebook political groups, Marichal
                                explores how Facebook's emphasis on social connection impacts key dimensions of
                                political participation: e.g., mobilization, deliberation, and attitude formation.
