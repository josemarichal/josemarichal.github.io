                    Global Politics in Everyday Life</p>

                <div class="portfolio-section">
                    <h2>Assignment Overview</h2>
                    <p>Global politics often feels abstract—something that happens in distant places, at high levels of
                        power, or in institutions students never directly encounter. This assignment is designed to
                        reverse that perspective. The <strong>Living Rights Portfolio</strong> asks you to explore how
                        global political ideas—power, freedom, security, inequality, democracy, capitalism, technology,
                        and belonging—are lived, felt, and negotiated in your everyday environment.</p>
                    <p>Rather than studying rights only as laws, treaties, or formal guarantees, this assignment focuses
                        on <em>living rights</em>: the practical ability to speak, move, participate, belong, access
                        resources, and feel secure in daily life. Living rights are not always written down. They emerge
                        through norms, rules, infrastructures, technologies, and power relations—often quietly and
                        unevenly.</p>
                    <p>Throughout the semester, we will connect major global theories and debates to concrete
                        experiences in spaces you already inhabit. The goal is not to evaluate whether your environment
                        is “good” or “bad,” but to understand how political power operates at close range.</p>

                    <h2>Structure of the Assignment</h2>
                    <p>Beginning in mid-February, most Fridays will be devoted to a <strong>Living Rights
                            exercise</strong> connected to that week’s readings. Each exercise asks you to observe,
                        analyze, and reflect on how a particular political theme appears in everyday life.</p>

                    <h3>Examples of living rights themes include:</h3>
                    <ul class="portfolio-list">
                        <li>Access to resources and support</li>
                        <li>Participation and voice</li>
                        <li>Security and surveillance</li>
                        <li>Belonging and exclusion</li>
                        <li>Technology and control</li>
                        <li>Sustainability and infrastructure</li>
                        <li>Knowledge, transparency, and information</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Each Friday activity will be grounded in the theoretical material you have already encountered
                        that week. For example, discussions of capitalism may lead to examining how resources are
                        distributed; discussions of democracy may lead to examining how decisions are made and who
                        participates; discussions of AI may lead to examining how technology shapes opportunity and
                        constraint.</p>

                <div class="portfolio-section">
                    <h2>Weekly Portfolio Reflections & "AI-Proofing" Rules</h2>
                    <p>After each Living Rights exercise, you will submit a brief written reflection (approximately
                        300–400 words) to your portfolio. To ensure this work reflects your unique, physical presence
                        and cannot be simulated by AI, you must adhere to the following <strong>three
                            constraints</strong> for every entry.</p>

                    <div
                        style="background-color: #fce4ec; border-left: 5px solid #c2185b; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-radius: 4px;">
                        <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #c2185b;">The 3 Constraints</h3>
                        <ol style="padding-left: 1.5rem; color: #333;">
                            <li style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>The "Friday Witness" Rule:</strong> You must
                                include at least one specific detail from our Friday in-class activity that cannot be
                                obtained from the readings. (e.g., A specific quote from a peer, a unique moment during
                                the exercise). You must <strong>bold</strong> this reference.</li>
                            <li style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>The "Sensory Audit" Rule:</strong> AI is abstract;
                                you are embodied. You must include <strong>three distinct sensory details</strong> from
                                your observation (e.g., specific text on a flyer, the layout of a room, the noise
                                level). Reflections that remain abstract or generic will not be credited.</li>
                            <li><strong>The "Artifact" Evidence:</strong> Each entry must be accompanied by a photo you
                                took or a sketch you made of the space/object you are analyzing. Your text must
                                explicitly reference a detail visible in this image.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Structure of Your Reflection:</h3>
                    <ul class="portfolio-list">
                        <li><strong>Observation:</strong> What did you see? (Include your Sensory Details and Artifact
                            reference here).</li>
                        <li><strong>Connection:</strong> How does this connect to class concepts? (Include your "Friday
                            Witness" bolded reference here).</li>
                        <li><strong>Reflection:</strong> What does this reveal about power/rights in your daily life?
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h2>What This Assignment Is (and Is Not)</h2>
                    <ul class="portfolio-list">
                        <li>This is an exercise in political thinking, not political advocacy</li>
                        <li>This is about making abstract ideas tangible, not about personal opinion alone</li>
                        <li>This is not a diary, complaint log, or policy proposal</li>
                        <li>This is not about exposing individuals or violating privacy</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>The emphasis is on analysis, not judgment.</strong></p>

                <div class="portfolio-section">
                    <h2>Learning Goals</h2>
                    <p>By completing the Living Rights Portfolio, you will:</p>
                    <ul class="portfolio-list">
                        <li>Learn how global political theories apply beyond states and institutions</li>
                        <li>Develop the ability to observe power in everyday contexts</li>
                        <li>Strengthen analytical writing through regular, low-stakes reflection</li>
                        <li>Understand politics as something that is lived, not just studied</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Global politics does not only exist in international organizations, governments, or crises. It
                        exists wherever rules are made, enforced, negotiated, resisted, or taken for granted. This
                        assignment asks you to notice it where you already are.</p>
