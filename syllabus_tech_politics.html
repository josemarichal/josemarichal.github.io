                    <h3>About the Instructor</h3>
                    <p>Dr. Marichal is a Professor of Political Science at California Lutheran University. He studies
                        the role that social media plays in restructuring political behavior and institutions. In 2012,
                        his book <em>Facebook Democracy</em> (Routledge Press) was published: it looks at the ways in
                        which social media platforms encourage antagonistic political discourse and how they could be
                        regulated. In addition, Dr. Marichal organized the Western Political Science Association’s
                        mini-conference on Algorithmic Politics. Currently, he is working on a book focused on the
                        damaging effects among citizens of “algorithmic mentality” on democracy.</p>

                <section class="syllabus-unit">
                    <h2>Course Description</h2>
                    <p>This course will examine the role that data collection (e.g. social media apps or Alexa personal
                        assistants) and analysis tools (machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms) play in
                        our daily lives and upon social/political/economic institutions. This course will draw from a
                        broad range of disciplines (Political Science, Information Science, Sociology, Law,
                        Communication, Philosophy, Psychology, etc.) to explore these questions.</p>

                    <h2>Course Policies</h2>
                    <p>In creating a learning environment in which diversity is embraced and contradictions are
                        explored, it is important that all students feel safe, respected, and free to address the
                        complex subjects and feelings that may arise as a result of readings and discussions. Therefore,
                        it is imperative that all of us treat each topic and each other with maturity and respect. Your
                        contributions to class discussions will be important and valued aspects of this course. If you
                        are uncomfortable with frank and open discussions, then you may want to reconsider taking this
                        course.</p>
                    <p>Throughout this course, we agree that “what’s said in the classroom, stays in the classroom”, and
                        this holds true, even if some of class activities are online/via Zoom: students are not
                        permitted to record or otherwise share in-person or online class sessions or interactions with
                        faculty, guest speakers and/or each other. Your continued enrollment in this course signifies
                        your agreement to abide by the terms and conditions of this syllabus and of all course
                        requirements. This syllabus is subject to change. Every effort will be made to alert students to
                        changes that occur in a timely manner: modifications will be discussed in Zoom class session
                        and/or via Canvas announcement/email: you are required to regularly check your CLU email account
                        and the course Canvas page.</p>

                    <h2>Course Format & Delivery</h2>
                    <p>This 15-week course will align with public health protocols (e.g., vaccination documentation or
                        waiver, correct use of appropriate masks when necessary, and required reporting of COVID19
                        exposure, symptoms or infection). Following COVID protocols, I will announce via Canvas/email if
                        a class session requires us to meet via online Zoom: see our course Canvas page for a Zoom link
                        for any online class session.</p>
                </section>

                <!-- Requirements -->
                <section class="syllabus-unit">
                    <h2>Course Requirements</h2>
                    <p>Students join class on time, prepared to learn (i.e., be ready to focus on class-related
                        activities). If you are unable to participate in class, due to illness or other reasons, then
                        review the discussion slides and any other class materials which will be uploaded/shared via
                        Canvas after each session. Most key concepts needed to complete course assignments will be noted
                        in the discussion slides and/or shared online via Canvas.</p>
                    <p>Talking, working, and thinking with others are key to this course. We will discuss controversial
                        subjects. I encourage expressions of opinions, but our class (including online interactions)
                        will be a safe place. That is to say, we will all treat each other in a respectful manner. Rude
                        interruptions and personal attacks (including racial, gender, sexuality, etc. slurs) will not be
                        tolerated. You may not always be comfortable with topics, and you are not expected to approve of
                        all that we discuss.</p>
                    <p>If a professor or a guest-speaker find your behavior to be disruptive or disrespectful – to us,
                        to other students or to guest-speakers – then you may have to leave the class session.</p>
                    <p>Readings and viewings for the day need to be completed prior to class start-time: class
                        activities, discussions, etc. will primarily draw upon assigned material. Bring detailed notes
                        on readings/viewings to each class session.</p>

                    <h3>Statement on Academic Honesty</h3>
                    <p>The educational programs of California Lutheran University are designed and dedicated to achieve
                        academic excellence, honesty and integrity at every level of student life. Part of CLU’s
                        dedication to academic excellence is our commitment to academic honesty. Students, faculty,
                        staff and administration share the responsibility for maintaining high levels of scholarship on
                        campus. Any behavior or act which might be defined as “deceitful” or “dishonest” will meet with
                        appropriate disciplinary sanctions, including dismissal from the University, suspension, grade F
                        in a course or various forms of academic probation. Policies and procedures regarding academic
                        honesty are contained in the faculty and student handbooks. Plagiarism, cheating, unethical
                        computer use and facilitation of academic dishonest are examples of behavior which will result
                        in disciplinary sanctions. Plagiarism includes, but is not limited to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>word for word copying without using quotation marks or presenting the work as yours</li>
                        <li>not citing quoted material – students must cite sources for any information that is not
                            either the result of original research or common knowledge</li>
                        <li>using ideas or work of others without acknowledgement (including AI-generated text)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>All assignments and exams must be submitted on time online as a PDF attachment (via Canvas link
                        under that week). Missed assignments or exams will be marked down as zeroes. Late
                        assignments/exams will be graded when documentation of an emergency is provided. During this
                        pandemic, Cal Lutheran has asked professors to determine the best ways for students to continue
                        with coursework when needing to miss class due to illness or quarantine/isolation.</p>

                    <p>Follow all public health protocol: see <a
                            href="https://www.callutheran.edu/know/">https://www.callutheran.edu/know/</a>.</p>

                    <p>Prior to due date/time, submit assignments via course Canvas page; if Canvas is having technical
                        difficulties, then email it to me as PDF attachment. Assignments must be typed, double-spaced,
                        12-point (legible) font, with 1-inch margins all around, spell-checked, grammar-checked, pages
                        numbered, and correct citation/reference format (APA Style; no abstracts required).</p>

                        with ADA of 1990 and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to students with documented
                        disabilities. If requesting accommodations for this course, then register with Disability

                        harassment, misconduct, and/or assault. If you report to a faculty member, then they must notify
                        the Title IX Coordinator about the incident.</p>

                    <h2>Course Assignments & Assessment</h2>
                    <p><strong>Leading Deliberative Discussion (15 x 1 = 15 points):</strong> Twice during the semester,
                        you will be part of a group that leads discussion. We will divide the class into groups,
                        assigning each group a specific AI-related ethical dilemma (e.g., facial recognition, autonomous
                        vehicles). Groups of three will be assigned to lead discussion and present arguments for and
                        against the ethical implications of their assigned topic. This will be structured less as a
                        debate and more of an exploration of diverse ideas on the topic with the ultimate goal of
                        engaging in constructive discussions and work towards a consensus on how to address the ethical
                        concerns. During these sessions, we will explore elements of effective argumentation and
                        evidence evaluation, aspects of critical thinking and logical reasoning and how to craft a well
                        constructed argument. Other students will be play the role of devil’s advocate.</p>

                    <p><strong>Exams (2 exams x 25 points = 50 points):</strong> Because this is a writing intensive
                        course, you’ll be asked to write. You will have two take home essay exams in which you will be
                        asked to apply the theories and concepts learned to specific questions. At the end of our final
                        section of the course, we will do a second exam that will have the same objectives. Each essay
                        exam will be worth 25 points.</p>

                    <p><strong>Debate (25 points):</strong> At the end of the the semester, we will have a structured
                        debate in groups.. where each person will be assigned to represent different constituencies on
                        digital privacy (technology companies, government agencies, cybersecurity experts, and privacy
                        advocates). The assignment will be broken down into three sections:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Identifying reliable sources.</strong> You will provide me with 7 sources you will
                            use in your debate.</li>
                        <li><strong>Argument analysis.</strong> You will produce a rough draft of five major arguments.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Final statement.</strong> You will be required to prepare a brief statement
                            outlining your assigned constituency’s viewpoint and supporting evidence. This statement
                            will be prepared three weeks before the assignment and distributed to me and the other
                            members of your group that will provide peer feedback.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Case Study Analysis Portfolio (10 points):</strong> Each Friday, you will be assigned a
                        case study based on the week’s readings. An example might be the topic of data security breaches
                        in various industries (e.g., Equifax, Facebook). You will be asked to identify the causes,
                        consequences, and the ethical considerations involved and to come prepared to have a group
                        discussion where you propose alternative strategies to address the case. You will be asked to
                        role play multiple different constituencies on digital privacy (technology companies, government
                        agencies, cybersecurity experts, and privacy advocates). You will write a reflection on your
                        participation upon the case study assignments to the Canvas discussion at the end of class.</p>
