                    <h3>About the Instructor</h3>
                    <p>Dr. Marichal is a Professor of Political Science at California Lutheran University. He studies
                        the role that social media plays in restructuring political behavior and institutions. In 2012,
                        his book <em>Facebook Democracy</em> (Routledge Press) was published: it looks at the ways in
                        which social media platforms encourage antagonistic political discourse and how they could be
                        regulated. In addition, Dr. Marichal organized the Western Political Science Association’s
                        mini-conference on Algorithmic Politics. Currently, he is working on a book focused on the
                        damaging effects among citizens of “algorithmic mentality” on democracy.</p>

                <section class="syllabus-unit">
                    <h2>Course Description</h2>
                    <p>This course will examine the role that data collection (e.g. social media apps or Alexa personal
                        assistants) and analysis tools (machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms) play in
                        our daily lives and upon social/political/economic institutions. This course will draw from a
                        broad range of disciplines (Political Science, Information Science, Sociology, Law,
                        Communication, Philosophy, Psychology, etc.) to explore these questions.</p>

                <section class="syllabus-unit">
                    <h2>Course Policies</h2>
                    <p>In creating a learning environment in which diversity is embraced and contradictions are
                        explored, it is important that all students feel safe, respected, and free to address the
                        complex subjects and feelings that may arise as a result of readings and discussions. Therefore,
                        it is imperative that all of us treat each topic and each other with maturity and respect. Your
                        contributions to class discussions will be important and valued aspects of this course. If you
                        are uncomfortable with frank and open discussions, then you may want to reconsider taking this
                        course.</p>
                    <p>Throughout this course, we agree that “what’s said in the classroom, stays in the classroom”, and
                        this holds true, even if some of class activities are online/via Zoom: students are not
                        permitted to record or otherwise share in-person or online class sessions or interactions with
                        faculty, guest speakers and/or each other. Your continued enrollment in this course signifies
                        your agreement to abide by the terms and conditions of this syllabus and of all course
                        requirements. This syllabus is subject to change. Every effort will be made to alert students to
                        changes that occur in a timely manner: modifications will be discussed in Zoom class session
                        and/or via Canvas announcement/email: you are required to regularly check your CLU email account
                        and the course Canvas page.</p>

                    <h2>Course Format & Delivery</h2>
                    <p>This 15-week course will align with public health protocols (e.g., vaccination documentation or
                        waiver, correct use of appropriate masks when necessary, and required reporting of COVID19
                        exposure, symptoms or infection). Following COVID protocols, I will announce via Canvas/email if
                        a class session requires us to meet via online Zoom: see our course Canvas page for a Zoom link
                        for any online class session.</p>
                </section>

                <!-- Requirements -->
                <section class="syllabus-unit">
                    <h2>Course Requirements</h2>
                    <p>Students join class on time, prepared to learn (i.e., be ready to focus on class-related
                        activities). If you are unable to participate in class, due to illness or other reasons, then
                        review the discussion slides and any other class materials which will be uploaded/shared via
                        Canvas after each session. Most key concepts needed to complete course assignments will be noted
                        in the discussion slides and/or shared online via Canvas.</p>
                    <p>Talking, working, and thinking with others are key to this course. We will discuss controversial
                        subjects. I encourage expressions of opinions, but our class (including online interactions)
                        will be a safe place. That is to say, we will all treat each other in a respectful manner. Rude
                        interruptions and personal attacks (including racial, gender, sexuality, etc. slurs) will not be
                        tolerated. You may not always be comfortable with topics, and you are not expected to approve of
                        all that we discuss.</p>
                    <p>If a professor or a guest-speaker find your behavior to be disruptive or disrespectful – to us,
                        to other students or to guest-speakers – then you may have to leave the class session.</p>
                    <p>Readings and viewings for the day need to be completed prior to class start-time: class
                        activities, discussions, etc. will primarily draw upon assigned material. Bring detailed notes
                        on readings/viewings to each class session.</p>

                    <h3>Statement on Academic Honesty</h3>
                    <p>The educational programs of California Lutheran University are designed and dedicated to achieve
                        academic excellence, honesty and integrity at every level of student life. Part of CLU’s
                        dedication to academic excellence is our commitment to academic honesty. Students, faculty,
                        staff and administration share the responsibility for maintaining high levels of scholarship on
                        campus. Any behavior or act which might be defined as “deceitful” or “dishonest” will meet with
                        appropriate disciplinary sanctions, including dismissal from the University, suspension, grade F
                        in a course or various forms of academic probation. Policies and procedures regarding academic
                        honesty are contained in the faculty and student handbooks. Plagiarism, cheating, unethical
                        computer use and facilitation of academic dishonest are examples of behavior which will result
                        in disciplinary sanctions. Plagiarism includes, but is not limited to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>word for word copying without using quotation marks or presenting the work as yours</li>
                        <li>not citing quoted material – students must cite sources for any information that is not
                            either the result of original research or common knowledge</li>
                        <li>using ideas or work of others without acknowledgement (including AI-generated text)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>All assignments and exams must be submitted on time online as a PDF attachment (via Canvas link
                        under that week). Missed assignments or exams will be marked down as zeroes. Late
                        assignments/exams will be graded when documentation of an emergency is provided. During this
                        pandemic, Cal Lutheran has asked professors to determine the best ways for students to continue
                        with coursework when needing to miss class due to illness or quarantine/isolation.</p>

                    <p>Follow all public health protocol: see <a
                            href="https://www.callutheran.edu/know/">https://www.callutheran.edu/know/</a>.</p>

                    <p>Prior to due date/time, submit assignments via course Canvas page; if Canvas is having technical
                        difficulties, then email it to me as PDF attachment. Assignments must be typed, double-spaced,
                        12-point (legible) font, with 1-inch margins all around, spell-checked, grammar-checked, pages
                        numbered, and correct citation/reference format (APA Style; no abstracts required).</p>

                        with ADA of 1990 and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to students with documented
                        disabilities. If requesting accommodations for this course, then register with Disability

                    <h3>Sexual Misconduct</h3>
                    <p>California Lutheran University does not tolerate any degree of sexual misconduct on or
                        off-campus. We encourage you to report if you know of, or have been the victim of, sexual
                        harassment, misconduct, and/or assault. If you report to a faculty member, then they must notify
                        the Title IX Coordinator about the incident.</p>

                    <h3>Part 2: Capstone Project (40 Points)</h3>
                    <p><strong>"The Campus Listening Experiment: A Participatory AI Lab Simulation"</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Format:</strong> Group Project (3–4 Students per Team)</p>
                    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> In this capstone, you will act as a "Participatory AI Lab" research
                        team. Your goal is to use AI to "listen" to student sentiment regarding a contentious campus
                        issue. You will generate raw data (via survey), process it using Machine Learning (BERTopic),
                        and then audit the results to determine if the algorithm captured the "truth" or merely
                        optimized the "average."</p>

                    <h4>Phase 1: Data Generation (10 Points)</h4>
                    <p><strong>Due: Wednesday, Apr 1</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Step A: Select a Topic.</strong> Pick a campus issue that generates "thick"
                            discourse and affects student life (e.g., The cost of meal plans, Parking enforcement,
                            Campus safety/policing, Academic Freedom, or DEI initiatives).</li>
                        <li><strong>Step B: The Survey.</strong> Design a Qualtrics survey to capture student sentiment.
                            <br><em>Constraint:</em> You must include at least two Open-Ended Questions (e.g., "Describe
                            a specific experience you had with..." or "Why do you feel this way?"). We need text data to
                            analyze, not just multiple-choice statistics.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Step C: Collection.</strong> Distribute the survey to your peers.
                            <br><em>Target:</em> Minimum 30–50 responses per group to generate a sufficient corpus for
                            analysis.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Deliverable:</strong> A raw .csv file of your survey responses submitted to Canvas.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Phase 2: The Machine Analysis (15 Points)</h4>
                    <p><strong>Due: Wednesday, Apr 22</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Step A: The Pipeline.</strong> Using the Google Colab notebook provided in class,
                            run your raw text data through the BERTopic model.</li>
                        <li><strong>Step B: The Output.</strong> Generate the following artifacts:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Topic Clusters: A list of the Top 5 themes the AI identified.</li>
                                <li>Visualization: An "Intertopic Distance Map" showing how the ideas relate spatially.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Step C: The "Civic Insight Brief."</strong> Write a 2-page report summarizing what
                            the AI thinks the students care about. Write this as if you were a consultant delivering a
                            "neutral" summary to the University Administration. (e.g., "The AI identified 'Cost' as the
                            primary cluster, with 'Quality' as a distant second.")</li>
                        <li><strong>Deliverable:</strong> The Colab Notebook output + The 2-Page Brief.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Phase 3: The Human Audit & Reflection (15 Points)</h4>
                    <p><strong>Due: Wednesday, May 13 (Finals Week)</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Step A: The "Human Essentiality" Audit.</strong> Compare your Raw Data (Phase 1) to
                            the Machine Output (Phase 2). Read the actual comments that the AI summarized.</li>
                        <li><strong>Step B: The Reflection Paper (3–4 Pages).</strong> Answer the following questions
                            using the course theory:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>The Erasure Audit:</strong> Who got optimized away? Look at the "outlier"
                                    comments that didn't fit into a cluster. Did the AI miss sarcasm, emotion, or
                                    minority viewpoints? (Reference Unit 3: The Epistemic Shift).</li>
                                <li><strong>The "Vibes" Check:</strong> Did the AI capture the intensity (Thymos) of the
                                    student sentiment, or just the keywords? Does the summary feel "true"?</li>
                                <li><strong>The Policy Recommendation:</strong> Based on this experiment, write a "Best
                                    Practices" statement. Should the University use AI to summarize student feedback? If
                                    so, what human guardrails are needed to preserve the "Ontological Integrity" of the
                                    student voice?</li>
