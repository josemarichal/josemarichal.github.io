                    <h2>Instructor information</h2>
                    <p><strong>Dr. José Marichal</strong> (he/him/his)<br>
                        Professor of Political Science<br>
                        Office Hours: SWEN 228: MWF 2:00 to 3:00; Zoom Tue 12:00-2:00<br>
                        Contact: <a href="mailto:marichal@callutheran.edu">marichal@callutheran.edu</a><br>
                        Time and Place: (HUM) 110</p>

                    <h3>About the Instructor</h3>
                    <p>I am a professor of political science at California Lutheran University. I specialize in studying
                        the role that algorithms and AI play in restructuring social and political institutions. I am
                        the author of "You Must Become an Algorithmic Problem" that came out in
                        2025 with Bristol University Press (UK). The book explores the unwritten social contract we have
                        with the algorithms that shape what we see, hear and think. I have a number of projects with
                        collaborators looking at how social media shapes political discourse. My next project is
                        entitled "Machine Liberalism." It looks at how algorithms and AI are changing our expectations
                        of liberal democracy. That book will come out with Intellect Books/University of Chicago Press
                        in 2027. I am also the founder and director of the Participatory AI Lab at California Lutheran
                        University.</p>

                <!-- Course Description -->
                <section class="syllabus-unit">
                    <h2>Course Description</h2>
                    <p>In a book that I'm working on, I argue that we live in an era of Machine Liberalism—a new social
                        contract where citizens trade their autonomy for the promise of algorithmic prediction and
                        convenience. This course investigates how the tools of data collection (social media, smart
                        devices) and analysis (AI, machine learning) are fundamentally reshaping the "Liberal Subject."
                        Historically, liberal democracy assumed citizens were autonomous agents capable of
                        reasonableness. Today, algorithms optimize us for predictability and preemption, challenging our
                        capacity for self-government.</p>
                    <p>Drawing from Political Science, Communication, Information Science, Sociology, English,
                        Philosophy and Law, we will explore how this shift from "Rights" to "Optimization" impacts
                        everything from free speech and labor to intimacy and security.</p>
                    <p>This course operates as a "Living Syllabus." We will engage directly with the leading scholars in
                        the field—co-affiliates of the Center for Information, Technology, and Public Life (CITAP) at
                        the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill— many of whom will join us weekly via a Friday
                        Zoom session to discuss their work with us. Furthermore, the course will function as a
                        Participatory AI Lab, where we will use computational tools to identify a local problem, gather
                        data and opinion, identify best practices, analyze data and recommend solutions... all using AI
                        tools. Our ultimate goal is to determine whether AI can be reclaimed for democratic and
                        inclusive purposes and to reflect on our experience using these tools for "good."</p>

                <section class="syllabus-unit">
                    <h2>Course Policies</h2>
                    <p>In creating a learning environment in which diversity is embraced and contradictions are
                        explored, it is important that all students feel safe, respected, and free to address the
                        complex subjects and feelings that may arise as a result of readings and discussions. Therefore,
                        it is imperative that all of us treat each topic and each other with maturity and respect. Your
                        contributions to class discussions will be important and valued aspects of this course. If you
                        are uncomfortable with frank and open discussions, then you may want to reconsider taking this
                        course.</p>
                    <p>Throughout this course, we agree that “what’s said in the classroom, stays in the classroom”, and
                        this holds true, even if some of class activities are online/via Zoom: students are not
                        permitted to record or otherwise share in-person or online class sessions or interactions with
                        faculty, guest speakers and/or each other. Your continued enrollment in this course signifies
                        your agreement to abide by the terms and conditions of this syllabus and of all course
                        requirements. This syllabus is subject to change. Every effort will be made to alert students to
                        changes that occur in a timely manner: modifications will be discussed in Zoom class session
                        and/or via Canvas announcement/email: you are required to regularly check your CLU email account
                        and the course Canvas page.</p>

                <!-- Requirements -->
                <section class="syllabus-unit">
                    <h2>Course Requirements</h2>
                    <p>Students join class on time, prepared to learn (i.e., be ready to focus on class-related
                        activities). If you are unable to participate in class, due to illness or other reasons, then
                        review the discussion slides and any other class materials which will be uploaded/shared via
                        Canvas after each session. Most key concepts needed to complete course assignments will be noted
                        in the discussion slides and/or shared online via Canvas.</p>
                    <p>Talking, working, and thinking with others are key to this course. We will discuss controversial
                        subjects. I encourage expressions of opinions, but our class (including online interactions)
                        will be a safe place. That is to say, we will all treat each other in a respectful manner. Rude
                        interruptions and personal attacks (including racial, gender, sexuality, etc. slurs) will not be
                        tolerated. You may not always be comfortable with topics, and you are not expected to approve of
                        all that we discuss.</p>
                    <p>If a professor or a guest-speaker find your behavior to be disruptive or disrespectful – to us,
                        to other students or to guest-speakers – then you may have to leave the class session.</p>
                    <p>Readings and viewings for the day need to be completed prior to class start-time: class
                        activities, discussions, etc. will primarily draw upon assigned material. Bring detailed notes
                        on readings/viewings to each class session.</p>

                    <h3>Statement on Academic Honesty</h3>
                    <p>The educational programs of California Lutheran University are designed and dedicated to achieve
                        academic excellence, honesty and integrity at every level of student life. Part of CLU’s
                        dedication to academic excellence is our commitment to academic honesty. Students, faculty,
                        staff and administration share the responsibility for maintaining high levels of scholarship on
                        campus. Any behavior or act which might be defined as “deceitful” or “dishonest” will meet with
                        appropriate disciplinary sanctions, including dismissal from the University, suspension, grade F
                        in a course or various forms of academic probation. Policies and procedures regarding academic
                        honesty are contained in the faculty and student handbooks. Plagiarism, cheating, unethical
                        computer use and facilitation of academic dishonest are examples of behavior which will result
                        in disciplinary sanctions. Plagiarism includes, but is not limited to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>word for word copying without using quotation marks or presenting the work as yours</li>
                        <li>not citing quoted material – students must cite sources for any information that is not
                            either the result of original research or common knowledge</li>
                        <li>using ideas or work of others without acknowledgement (including AI-generated text)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>All assignments and exams must be submitted on time online as a PDF attachment (via Canvas link
                        under that week). Missed assignments or exams will be marked down as zeroes. Late
                        assignments/exams will be graded when documentation of an emergency is provided. During this
                        pandemic, Cal Lutheran has asked professors to determine the best ways for students to continue
                        with coursework when needing to miss class due to illness or quarantine/isolation.</p>

                    <p>Follow all public health protocol: see <a

                    <h3>Part 1: The "Machine Liberalism" Reflexive Journal (60 Points)</h3>
                    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> To connect the theoretical concepts of each Unit to the real-world
                        implications for democratic life.</p>
                    <p><strong>Format:</strong> For each of the 6 Units, you will submit a 2–3 page reflection paper.
                        This is not a summary of the readings. It is an application of the theory.</p>

                    <p><strong>The Prompts:</strong> Instead of a generic summary, answer the specific thematic question
                        for each Unit
                        below. Your goal is to connect the broad theoretical argument to the specific
                        readings/discussions
                        of the week.</p>

                    <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                        <li><strong>Unit 1 (Theory):</strong> How does the shift from "Rights" to "Design" (or
                            Optimization)
                            fundamentally alter the social contract between the citizen and the state?</li>
                        <li><strong>Unit 2 (Economy):</strong> In what ways does the "attention economy" or the demand
                            for
                            "metrics" reshape our understanding of labor—specifically the labor of specific
                            self-presentation?</li>
                        <li><strong>Unit 3 (Epistemic):</strong> How does the reliance on "machine certainty" or
                            algorithmic
                            prediction change what counts as "truth" or "expertise" in public discourse?</li>
                        <li><strong>Unit 4 (Security):</strong> How does the logic of "preemption" (stopping risks
                            before
                            they happen) challenge traditional notions of justice, due process, or innocence?</li>
                        <li><strong>Unit 5 (Social):</strong> How do algorithmic structures mediate our intimate
                            relationships or community bonds, and what specific form of "sociality" is produced by these
                            tools?</li>
                        <li><strong>Unit 6 (Resistance):</strong> Is meaningful resistance to "Machine Liberalism"
                            possible
                            through individual action (opting out), or does it require a structural/collective response?
                            What would that look like?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Part 2: Participatory AI Lab Project: Agentic Policy Entrepreneurship (40 Points)</h3>
                    <p><strong>Format:</strong> Group Project (3–4 Students per Team)</p>
                    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> "Vibe-Solving" for the Public Sector: Balancing the Possible and the
                        Political.</p>
                    <p>In the public sector, a "Policy Entrepreneur" faces a dual challenge. You must design a solution
                        that is <em>politically survivable</em> (it won't be killed by established interests), but also
                        <em>imaginative enough</em> to break the status quo.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>The "Manager" Mindset:</strong> You will use AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.) as
                        your "Policy Lab Staff." You will delegate research to them to find what is working elsewhere
                        ("Best Practices"), while also using them to simulate the political opposition ("Red Teaming").
                        Your goal is to find the "Politics of the Possible"—the sweet spot where innovation meets
                        feasibility.</p>

                    <h3>Unit 1: The Theoretical Shift - From Rights to Design</h3>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">Historically, Liberalism assumed the
                        citizen was an autonomous, rights-bearing subject—an agent capable of reason, choice, and
                        self-definition. Today, the Digital Subject is defined not by autonomy, but by legibility and
                        predictability. In this unit, we explore how the "Socio-Technical Contract" has rewritten the
                        rules of democratic life: moving from a system that protects rights (speech, privacy) to a
                        system that engineers "Ontological Integrity" (safety from disruption).</p>

                    <h3>Unit 2: The Economic Shift</h3>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">We have moved from an economy of Production to an economy of
                        Optimization. In this unit, we examine how the logic of AdTech and performance metrics has
                        colonized our political identity. The citizen is no longer a participant in the public sphere;
                        they are a "Brand" managing their reputation in an attention economy. We explore how labor is
                        disciplined by metrics and how political movements are packaged as lifestyle brands.</p>

                    <h3>Unit 3: The Epistemic Shift - Knowledge, Truth, and "Machine Certainty"</h3>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">The Enlightenment
                        project was built on the ideal of Explanation—knowing why something is true. The AI era replaces
                        this with "Machine Certainty"—knowing that an answer is optimized, without understanding the
                        mechanism. We explore the rise of "Epistemic Arrogance," where algorithms provide answers that
                        feel authoritative but lack context. We look at how data is classified, how journalism is being
                        retooled by generative AI, and how "Vibes" replace facts.</p>

                    <h3>Unit 4: The Security Shift - Preemption, Surveillance, and the Face</h3>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">Liberal justice was
                        traditionally based on Deterrence—punishing bad acts after they occurred. Machine Liberalism is
                        based on Preemption—predicting risk before it happens. In this unit, we examine the rise of the
                        "Security Mindset," where the state uses predictive policing, facial recognition, and deepfake
                        analysis to manage populations. This shift erodes the presumption of innocence and transforms
                        the citizen from a subject of rights into a subject of risk.</p>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">We are trading the friction of human
                        Relationality (which requires vulnerability and shared fate) for the smoothness of Synthetic
                        Relationship (which offers comfort and control). We explore how AI is reshaping intimacy—from
                        "smart homes" that surveil us to platforms that police desire. What happens to human dignity
                        when our primary social interactions are optimized for engagement rather than connection?</p>

                        Contract" is broken, how do we renegotiate it? We move beyond the idea of "better regulation"
                        (fixing the algorithm) to the idea of Refusal (rejecting the optimization). We explore how
                        communities build solidarity, and conclude by asking how we can reclaim the "Right to be a
                        Problem."</p>
